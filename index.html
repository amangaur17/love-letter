                            <h1>Hey my Guchupuchu 👑❤️</h1>
                            <p>I've been thinking a lot about our call… and honestly, I feel really bad about how things turned out 😔. I know we ended up arguing — about that habit of yours, about the way I reacted, and about how we both felt misunderstood. And truthfully, that's not what I ever want between us.</p>
                            
                            <p>Maybe I sounded harsh or frustrated, and if I did — I'm so sorry, Eishu. It's not because I want to fight or hurt you. It's just that sometimes I get emotional, and I struggle to say what I really mean, which is that I care. Deeply. For you. For us 🫣💗</p>
                            
                            <p>Maybe I expected you to just get what I was feeling, but that wasn't fair. I should have paused and tried to understand your side too 💭. I didn't mean to make you feel like you're doing something wrong, or that you're not enough. Because my Queen, you are more than enough — you are everything to me 🫶👸🏻</p>
                            
                            <p>But the one thing that really stuck in my heart was when you said, "Go and think again if you're even investing emotion with me."<br>
                            Please, Eishu… please don't ever say that again 💔 Doesn't matter in what context — that sentence truly hurts me. Because you are the most precious part of my life. And not for a single moment have I ever doubted my feelings for you, or what we're building together 💞</p>
                            
                            <p>I don't want these little bumps to push us apart. Relationships aren't about perfection — they're about progress. About growing together, through the mess and the magic. We both have our flaws and habits, but the fact that we're willing to work on them together is what makes us strong 🧩💞</p>
                            
                            <p>Please always remember this, my Queen — no matter how big or small the issue, I will always stand by you 🤗. We might argue, we might stumble, but we'll always come back to each other stronger than before. Because that's us. That's Guplu and his Queen 💑✨</p>
                            
                            <p>So don't be upset for too long, my love. Please? Let's talk it out, not with anger, but with love and calm — just like the way our hearts want us to. Because truly, nothing matters more to me than you and me — us 🕊️💖</p>
                            
                            <p>I love you so much, Eishu. Always have, always will.<br>
                            Let's walk through every up and down together, hand in hand — just like we promised 🤍🌈</p>
